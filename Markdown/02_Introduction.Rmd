  warning = F, # For stuff like NAs introduced by coercion

  fig.align='center') # Figure alignment --> I don't really get how this works for LaTeX documents. Sometimes it works, sometimes not so much

<!-- Comments on YAML Header 

In principle, this can be completely different from your main file, e.g., a html notebook or a word document.

However, I think it generally makes sense to keep it in the same format, that way you can always check how it would look.

Cross-referencing across sections might not work, only if you knit the entire document from 01_Main.Rmd.
