# PaperTemplate

This is a simple template to write an empirical paper in RMarkdown. I do not claim that this is the most efficient or prettiest way of doing it, this just kind of came about using trial and error and some of the excellent online resources for Rmarkdown, Bookdown, etc.

I recommend to use tinytex as LaTeX distribution, as missing packages will be installed on the fly.

https://yihui.org/tinytex/

install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()

Feel free to use and distribute. I hope it helps :-)
